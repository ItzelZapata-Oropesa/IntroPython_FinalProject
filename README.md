# IntroPython_FinalProject
Final project for my Intro to Python class
For this project I decided to create a small guessing game between the user and the computer using various techniques learned throuout the semester.
This game was inspired by Alexa (Amazons virtual assiatant) "Akinator" feature, where Alexa tries to guess what is on the users mind. 
The graphics used for this were NOT created by me, they were extracted from https://www.asciiart.eu
